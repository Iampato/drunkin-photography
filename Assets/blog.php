                <h3>Beautiful Selfies</h3>
                <p>'m Patrick Waweru,At an early age I think I was lucky to have access to computers, 
                For I always believed that computers were for playing games but this narrative was change after
                I was introduced to coding by my Uncle after I finished primary school.
                I think the closest thing we have to super-power is coding..
                I have always been an achiever; be it academics or professional life or sports or any other field
                in my life. I believe in success through hard work & dedication. My motto in life is to ‘If you want something,
                work hard & you will achieve it; there are no shot cuts’. I enjoy life to the fullest & love humour.
